Planning & Operation Insights for Dockless Scooter-Sharing Systems - Usage Pattern Analysis
## Research Design: 
Despite extensive research on e-scooter usage patterns and influencing factors, most studies focus on urban areas, leaving a gap in understanding operational dynamics in university towns. Specifically, there is limited exploration of spatial associations between e-scooter usage patterns and built environment or street characteristics near university campuses. As shown below, this study addresses this gap using e-scooter trip data from Gainesville, Florida, where the university is a central economic driver. It applies an explainable machine learning approach – eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models combined with SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values – to analyze spatiotemporal ridership patterns, trip origins, destinations, purposes, and their relationships with the built environment and street features derived from Street View Images. The findings aim to improve e-scooter service management and integration in university settings, providing actionable insights for policymakers, operators, and planners to inform data-driven decisions on e-scooter placement and rebalancing, aimed at advancing sustainable micromobility in university contexts.

## Key Findings: 
From the perspective of dockless scooter-sharing operators, explainable decision tree models were applied to Gainesville e-scooter trip data. Results revealed strong weekly and hourly usage variations, as well as spatial clustering. Higher e-scooter usage was associated with areas of high population density, bike and transit infrastructure, and lower local road density. Trip origins were concentrated aroundtransportation, recreational, and social POIs, while destinations included educational and commercial areas, suggesting both commuting and leisure travel. These locations were typically in dense, active urban environments, indicating favorable riding conditions. The findings derived from this AI-assisted transport planning framework support improved placement, rebalancing, system design, and infrastructure planning for dockless micromobility.
