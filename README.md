Key Findings: From the perspective of dockless scooter-sharing operators, explainable decision tree models were applied to Gainesville e-scooter trip data. Results revealed strong weekly and hourly usage variations, as well as spatial clustering. Higher e-scooter usage was associated with areas of high population density, bike and transit infrastructure, and lower local road density. Trip origins were concentrated aroundtransportation, recreational, and social POIs, while destinations included educational and commercial areas, suggesting both commuting and leisure travel. These locations were typically in dense, active urban environments, indicating favorable riding conditions. The findings derived from this AI-assisted transport planning framework support improved placement, rebalancing, system design, and infrastructure planning for dockless micromobility.
